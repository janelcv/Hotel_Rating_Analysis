Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance.

This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in!

After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel.Perfectly fine hotel for a visit to SF), (2016, Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around.

Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!THE DC TRIP), (2014, Excellent experience.

Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub.beautiful, convenient location), (2014, It was a great staygreat!!!!!!), (2017, My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!Awesome Stay), (2014, Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic locationReasonable price for exceptional hotel), (2014, Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.Excellent!), (2011, The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..Great Room), (2010, THE LOCATION OF THE HOTEL WAS OUTSTANDING. BUT THERE IS AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR PARKING JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND . IF YOU PAY FOR PARKING AT THE TIME YOU CHECK - IN BE SURE TO HAVE IT OUT BEFORE 1 PM THE NEXT DAYGREAT LOCATION), (2016, was too quick, but very nice areagreat stay), (2013, clean, good area, very kind crew, easy to parkBest), (2014, We had a great overnight trip to the National Harbor near DC.

I give it 5 starsHampton inn), (2013, The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)....Overall it was good but AC sucks!!), (2013, Convenient and comfortable.

Very few channels and poor quality.TV sucks), (2013, Awesome, OverallWill definately stay there again), (2014, Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference.Great conference stay), (2016, Very good experience. Staff was great. Enjoyed my times especially after my previous fiasco at that other hotel.Nice), (2013, The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected.

It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.Friendly staff, large clean room.), (2012, Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars.

Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up.

We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas.

They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.)

There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us.

Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,Staff made our anniversary!</th>\n",

Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.Beautiful Hotel</th>\n",

       "Index: [(2002, Found the hotel to be conveniently located and tastefully decorated. Service was polite and prompt. My room was great: clean comfortable and again, tastefully decorated without looking suburban-generic. Try to get a balcony room if you can. It's so nice to be able to open the French doors and let the sounds of New Orleans into your room! Loved the rooftop pool, we were lucky enough not to have had too many children to deal with. I would definitely stay here again.Enjoyed My Stay), (2003, Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003. A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up. The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad. The carpeting looked a bit trafficked. Still, our overall experience was good.Who Maid the Bed), (2003, With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointedWhat a great place for kids, exceptional offstrip value), (2004, My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington.A recommendation for the Virginian Suites), (2004, The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50.It's Okay), (2004, The two bedroom suites worked out very well for kids. Staff of hotel were very helpful. Close to Disney and other attractions. Reasonably priced.Great family place to stay in Anaheim), (2004, We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed.Perfect for families), (2004, We were very pleased with this place. Helpful staff, big, clean, comfortable suite. 2BR suite was perfect for 2 adults 2 kids. (No breakfast, but it was a pleasant stroll to both Carl's Starbucks - can't complain!) Great deal for the - would definitely stay here again.spiffy), (2004, While the property is new and has great potential, they also have the rudest staff Management I have ever experienced. I'm a platnium Marriott member and have never before been to a hotel that tried so hard to make me uncomfortable. I shortened a 7 nite stay to 1 nite and found another hotel in the area that was happy to have my business and make me feel comfortable.Don't Stay Here), (2005, After arriving at BWI, I called the hotel for a shuttle. 45 minutes later, I called again. The shuttle had never been dispatched, so I had to wait another 20 minutes before it arrived. No apology was forthcoming. There is no business center at this hotel and the restaurant needs a major upgrade. The room, however, was well maintained and comfortable.They Forgot Me), (2005, Great accomodations for business or pleasure. Only 8-9 miles from downtown Balt. and Inner Harbor. Breakfast buffet was first class. Happy Hour from 5:30PM till 7PM was a bonus suprise. Highly recommend this locationQuite Impressed), (2005, Hotel graciously granted my request for a different room, as I was assigned a 3rd floor room between several occupied by very boisterous girls basketball team. Teachers/coaches let them run wild until well after midnight. Unfortunately the team continued to run up and down corridors on all 3 floors.Hotel fine rowdy guests (winning high school sports team lenient chaperones)), (2005, I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!more for your money!!!!!), (2005, I enjoyed my stay at this apartment(even though they were still renovating). The place was very nice,spacious and you didn't feel as though you were bumping heads with others in the apartment. It was like a home away from home.Simply Satisfied), (2005, I stayed with my sister in this hotel...Basically, as it was New Years, various other hotels closer to the the Strip were booked. The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!Far From Strip but Nice), (2005, It is alittle hard to find Get detailed directions Fast airport pickup Very nice employeesdirections), (2005, My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!Cool place, great staff!), (2005, Revamped retro boutique hotel with exemplary service and the coolest decorating...top notchdeco deluxe.....), (2005, So this isn't the best motel out there but the price is right and if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night it will do. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. You can bring your pets in the room with you. It's close to the freeway and Marie Callendars (which has wonderful breakfasts). Try it out you won't be disappointed.Isn't the best but does have a good bed.), (2005, This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great.Great, new hotel), (2005, This hotel certainly keeps with the Ritz Carlton name. Great surroundings. great service, and great food all made for a relaxing stay.Ritz Carlton - Pentagon CIty), (2005, This hotel was Amazing! Though it's not as hip as the W Hotel, The location is amazing - right across the street from K-Pauls and Nola's - two great restaurants. Also, the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer. I highly recommend this hotel!Great Pool and Views!), (2005, This was a very good hotel for our family. The management kept us together on the same floor and was very resposive to any needs we had. The continental breakfast was very acceptable. The business center was very easy to access while we were there. It is well located as to access to the interstates and has many good resturants close by. The Metro is close and very easy to access. I would have no qualms using this again the next time we are in the area.Good place to stay for Washington DC and Northern Virginia), (2005, We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.Cockroach with no assistance), (2005, With a great location close to everything, the Austin Motel is far from a boring Holiday Inn. It's great for first-timers to Austin, because it is infused with lots of local charm. Great bars and live music venues are a short walk away.Funky and Fun), (2006, All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us.Outstanding Family Hotel), (2006, Didn't stay long enough to really review things, but the room was pretty clean, even though I think my toilet was leaking. Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night. If you're wanting an ocean-view, look elsewhere. It's worth the price I paid.Got the job done), (2006, Filthy hotel! Bed bugs or fleas, not sure which but we scratched all night. Dirty rags, dirty tub, nasty carpet and sheets. Should have been tipped off when I had to wade through trash overflowing the trash can in the breakfast area. Mgr. wouldn't return phone calls (3) and when I finally reached him, he said he'd give me 10.... MoreBeware!!!!), (2006, I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms.best deal for the price), (2006, IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location.Good location), (2006, Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet.Virginia Beach Conference Center), (2006, The hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The hallways were somewhat dirty(rugs not vacuumed on a regular basis)The food was okay which is fine since we ate out alot. I would definitely stay again.Friendly Staff), (2006, They Hyatt Regency in Sacramento has great customer service and is very nice. It's within walking distance to the Convention Center and a lot of great restaurants.Convenient and nice!), (2006, This hotel has great dinner and breakfast package highly appreciated throughout the region. It make for a great place to hold family get togthers or just for a weekend get away. The staff is very friendly and helpful and makes repeat guests feel like they are coming home. The rooms could stand to be a little updated but the luxury suites are above and beyond.Great Hotel), (2006, This hotel is convenient to the metro and only a four stops from downtown Washington. It has limited shuttle service to the metro as well. My wife and I will use it again as a good alternative to the high-priced hotels downtown when feasible.Will use again), (2006, This was a convenient place to stay and then ride the Metro (only 1 mile walk) into DC to see the sights. The quality and value of the hotel were outstanding. I loved having a suite, it made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I called and requested extra towels and coffee and they brought them within 5 minutes.Perfect Place to stay close to Washington DC), (2006, This was a very nice hotel for the price. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was nice. Close to many restaurants and other business establishments. They do not have a work out facility but do have an association with the local YMCA and you can go there to exercise free of charge. I will go back there again when I have business in the area.Very Nice Hotel For The Price), (2006, This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!Well kept secret in Waikiki), (2006, We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!Great Value), (2006, We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers.Great for travelers!), (2006, room layout is very ideal as kids slept on pullout and we had separated king bed. tv swivels both ways!nice hotel), (2007, A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget.Best Western - Springfield Mall), (2007, A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.Nice Casino/Terrible Management), (2007, A single parent traveling with two children. I felt very safe. This hotel centrally located to everything. The room was very well kept. This hotel does not rate on the same scale as a five star hotel, but it does rate 5 stars for the kitchen facility, pool area and friendliness of staff. Book with confidence.Felt very safe...), (2007, Better maid serviceNeeds Improvement), (2007, Clean rooms and generally quiet made for good sleeping. The breakfast in the morning with eggs and waffles just can't be built. I have stayed here for 3 nights each week for the last 3 weeks and will continue to do that for the next 3 weeks. The prices are reasonable and I have recommended this hotel to my co-workers (who have also stayed here at times now).Good hotel for a good price), (2007, Close to Arlington Cemetery (15-20 minute walk)and Metro (10 min walk). Hotel is an older building but suitable for it's 2.5 star rating. Hi-speed internet in room was nice.A Good Value), (2007, Everything about this hotel is geared to the DC business traveler. Nothing is missing from the standpoint of communications inclusive of wireless net access. They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way.Best Western Springfield, VA), (2007, Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.The Best stay I've had in Waikiki), (2007, First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.Just the basics), (2007, First, this is a discount hotel so don't expect the Westin! The rooms are newly remodeled and clean. Request a room on the other side of the building from the highway and you will sleep fine. The neighborhood is fine and there are nice restaurants close by. I thought it was weird that I had to sign a paper stating... MoreComfortable for decent price), (2007, For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult.Good value convenient to the Metro), (2007, Fun decor in lobby and in rooms. Nice ammenities. Bed was extremely comforable, one of the best nights sleep ever!Very Convenient to attractions and dining in the Inner Harbour!), (2007, Good parking lot size at hotel - no problems finding a spot for me. Hotel had a Tues night guest reception which was well attended the night I went...had food and drinks there. Hotel is older, but very clean. Front desk and all of staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Room was like an apt in size/good kitchen set up. I extended my stay for 2 extra nights. I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well.Would definitely go back.), (2007, Great hotel, well kept but the room had some strange bad smell, no big deal. Only problem we had a baby with us and had requested a crib at least five days before, and when we got there they said they did not have any available, not safe at all to sleep with the baby in our bed. Otherwise the rest was ok.Great room for the money.), (2007, Great motel, especially if you want to be close to downtown and the MAX. Clean rooms, really helpful staff who know Portland, and excellent location.Good deal, good location), (2007, Great rooms for the price and great breakfast compared to the usual continental. Shuttle service to the Metro line very useful. Great way to travel to the downtown area and even to the airport.Great value for the money), (2007, I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again.My choice from now on when I visit DC), (2007, I enjoyed my 3-night stay here. I was given a nice room the continental breakfast was first rate. There was some trouble with one of the elevators, and the room was overly perfumed, but the staff were friendly and helpful.Nice for the price), (2007, I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.AnaHawaii), (2007, I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)Friendly staff, great location), (2007, I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was a hit with the kids and it was great that they had an on duty life guard. Continental breakfast was more than your typical free breakfast with hot food.quality for price), (2007, I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites.Very inexpensive with lots of room), (2007, I was really pleased with the choice I made to stay at this Best Western. I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price.Army ten miler weekend), (2007, I was surprised to find a newer Hilton at such a reasonable price. I thought there would be a catch though it turned out it was just a good find. Very nice.Nicer than I am used to for the price), (2007, I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service.Not impressed), (2007, I'm very satisfied with my 6 nights stay with the hotel. Very close to the metro. The room is huge, clean and comfortable. The kitchen with a microwave, fridge, range, cooking utensils and plates, is a plus. The staff is friendly.I highly recommend this hotel.Great place to stay. Convenient. Great price.), (2007, If you are looking for a place to have your wedding in Baltimore, this would be it. If you're looking to stay for the weekend, be aware that there is a chance there will be a lot of wedding activity, crowds and loud music. This might interrupt your stay.Wedding venue), (2007, It was a nice clean hotel, they give a free shuttle to the metro station. But on weekends the parking in the metro station is free so you can very well drive ur own car and park there. Breakfast was good too.Enjoyed my stay), (2007, It's very nice! And they have by far, the best continental breakfast with all the trimmings! We will definitely come back here.It's a great value!), (2007, Just dreadful, and scary. Was traveling alone with my dog. We were so tired, just needed somewhere to rest. What a filthy room, and the door did not shut tightly, you could see light through it...which wasn't too huge a problem until I was awoken in the middle of the night to loud party or something, which quickly turned into... MoreNo, no, no, never again!), (2007, Just wonderfulJust Lovely), (2007, My family stayed overnite, the staff was friendly and very helpful, large cleen room.Nice hotel very comfortable rooms), (2007, My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!A Perfect Hotel for a Perfect Getaway!!!!!!), (2007, My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Good Time in Waikiki), (2007, Nice hotel, but not enough people working there, which made check-in a drawn-out experience.Understaffed), (2007, Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.Wonderful Surprise), (2007, Outstanding Hotel. After spending the day at Inner Harbor, we spent the night at BWI's Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very friendly and helped us find a good place to eat. The rooms were very comfortable and very clean. The whole hotel, itself, was very well maintained.Outstanding Hotel), (2007, Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed.Great value), (2007, Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed.Price a little high), (2007, Rate is adecuate, good breakfast.Very comfortable.), (2007, Some years ago,my father in-law selected this hotel and we had a great time. After he stopped going the rest of us went down again but stayed somewhere else. Big mistake ,so this time it was without question as to where we were going. This will be our spot every year for a week. The people are great as well.The only place I would stay, when I go to Virginia Beach !), (2007, Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!Great Stay! Thanks Virginia!), (2007, Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!Great Location, Excellent Hospitality!), (2007, Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay.Best Place Ever), (2007, The Comfort Suite in chincoteague, VA had a sumptuous breakfast, with hot and cold choices, even fresh waffles daily. The room was large and comfortable, the housekeeping staff very on top of their work, and the front desk accomodating and available. The location is perfect - near enough to walk to the shops, near enough to Assateague for a quick beach drive. Lovely for children.Outstanding Hotel), (2007, The Hilton BWI was wonderful. We were greeted by staff that was friendly and helpful. The room was absolutely great. I was shocked by the 42 in Plasma TV with HD programming. The service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the price is right. I will be staying there with my wife again.Great Hotel), (2007, The Hotel was beautiful, staff very nice, and clean rooms. However, we got really lost going into the city and the front desk person was not from the area and could not help us at all with directions. The other was that we got a not request 6 a.m. wake up call that scared the two of us, we thought it was an emergency and bolted up across the room to find out it was a mistake.Two Minor Things), (2007, The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay. I would like to suggest that this particular Hotel whose location is right on the oceanfront, perhaps offer specials or services geared more towards romantic getaways.Great room for the money), (2007, The Suncoast Hotel itself was nice. The room we had was a standard king room and very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were rather industrial (hard). The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.Suncoast Hotel mixed review), (2007, The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.Great stay experience!), (2007, The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy.Old and Tired), (2007, The hotel is in a good location and works well for families with the kitchen set-up. Noisy on a Saturday night after events/parties,etc.Good location), (2007, The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend.great value for money), (2007, The hotel played loud music in common areas which were audible in the rooms as well. I called down at 1 a.m. to ask that the music be turned off. The receptionist was extremely apologetic and turned it off right away - but I was told that they generally keep it on all night.Loud ambient music), (2007, The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.Great location and nice price), (2007, The location is great, about 10 minutes' walk from Rosslyn Metro. Environment good too. The only thing I dislike is the check in time. Their standard check-in time is 3:00pm, but we actually cannot check-in until 3:40pm. Hotel staff kept telling us it would be 20 or 10 more minutes, but we waited from 1:00pm until 3:40pm. Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection. I vote for the location and price.Good price for the location), (2007, The reviews on this Best Western are all over the range of scores, but we all stayed at the same motel. Go figure! This is a basic services motel in an upscale county (Napa). Don't come here expecting frills and fancy decor. And what's wrong with eating breakfast at Dennys We used the coupons and our breakfast cost about 2 plus tip. If you are here to tour the wine country there are probably better places to stay. If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The Best Western suited our needs. Our room was clean and the furniture was in good shape. I can't speak to the ammenities since we just used the Best Western as a place to sleep, clean up and hit the road.What You See is What You Get), (2007, The room was clean but needs maintenance, wallpaper coming off the wall in the living room area of our suite. It is an older building and bathroom did not have extra outlet for appliances such as curling iron. It was nice and convenient having the kitchen. Good location! Convenient to many of the Arlington/ DC sites.Good location), (2007, The rooms were clean, well air-conditioned and large, with good bathrooms, basic cable TV and wireless Internet access. There's also a computer in the reception area. The desk service was very helpful and polite. There's a medium-sized outdoor pool. The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up.Good budget option), ...]\n",
